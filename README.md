# Hypothesis-Testing
Hypothesis or A/B testing with Frequentist and Bayesian approach.

How to Do A/B Testing?
First of all, a decision should be made about which variable A B test will be performed on. To go through a common example in digital marketing, let's talk about an experiment to be done on the CTA (Call-to-Action) text of an ad image. Let's assume that the current advertisement image says "Make an Appointment Now", and if we are wondering how it will perform, "Call Now". In the final stage, these two alternative texts should be evaluated under equal conditions.

When doing A/B testing, there are some factors that you need to pay attention to in order to be able to do it in the most effective way.

  Period: Both versions should be tested at the same time. If version A is tested in September and version B is tested in November, we  won't know if the results are different because of timing and not because of different elements.

  Randomness: Test groups should be randomly and equally divided so that the results are unbiased.

  Time: If the test is only done for a short time, the results may not be enough to make a decision.

 The correct test method must be selected. statistical hypotheses must be properly established and tested.

An example hypothesis to be established for the problem might be as follows:

H0: There is no statistically significant difference between the conversion rate value of the old system and the conversion rate value of the new system.

H1: There is a statistically significant difference between the conversion rate value of the old system and the conversion rate value of the new system.
